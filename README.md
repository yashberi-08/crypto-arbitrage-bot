⚙️ How It Works

The bot fetches real-time prices from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges.
It calculates the price spread between exchanges.
If the spread exceeds a certain threshold, it executes simultaneous buy and sell orders.
Profits are locked in when prices converge, making it a risk-free arbitrage.
